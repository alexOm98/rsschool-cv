## About Myself
### I have been working as a corporate lawyer for about 3 years. But due to various reasons I lost my passion for studying law and I wanted to change direction of my activity. When I was a student I helped my friends to create sites for their projects on Tilda, but I didn't like the limited functionality of site builders and I wanted to create more complex projects and expand my knowledge in this area. So I decided to start learning JS/FRONT-END course at the RS School.
